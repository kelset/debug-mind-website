Just a quick website for the [debug:mind series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiD6R_aXkpLiMfS2YrhSgtSj09JJCaP2y) üéôÔ∏èüß†

## Oh wow, this website is ugly!

I know right? You see, this website is the culmination of a few things:

- my absolute lack of skills when it comes to anything design-related
- my curiosity in coding AIs
- the fact that I want a static website is be as simple as possible

And that's why all the code so far as been written exclusively via [Grimoire GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-n7Rs0IK86-grimoire), a custom GPT that claims to be a "Coding Wizard". Of course at some point in the future I'd like this website to be much better than what it is today, but I had fun so far in trying to see the limits of this AI tool.
