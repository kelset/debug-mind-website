Welcome to the website of my [debug:mind series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiD6R_aXkpLiMfS2YrhSgtSj09JJCaP2y) üéôÔ∏èüß†

This website showcase 3 main things:

- the list of debug mind episodes
- the shorts extracted from said episodes
- all the various mental health resources I've found around the web (_originally collected into the separate repo [mental-health-resources](https://github.com/kelset/mental-health-resources)_)

### Good to know

- Content & illustrations (ASCII Illustrations & text) are separated into smaller html files in the `./partials` folder.
- the youtube episodes info are all stored in the `youtube-content.json` file
  - the shorts are ordered from the newest to the oldest
- Partials and Youtube content are added into the index.html by running `node predeploy.js` via `netlify.toml` on every push.
