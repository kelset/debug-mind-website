Thanks for wanting to contribute to this website!

As stated in the readme, this website in the current form is super barebones 💀 and I'd like to keep it as simple as possible.

But of course there's a lot of room for improvement, so feel free to send PRs my way. To do so, follow the standard GitHub procedure:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch in your forked repository.
3. Make your changes in the new branch.
4. Submit a pull request from the new branch in your forked repository to the main branch in the original repository.

I appreciate that you are even taking the time to read this 🤣 Feel free to add the emoji 🐉 to your PR title to let me know that you actually got this far!
